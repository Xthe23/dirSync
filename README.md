# dirSync

This Go script provides a utility to copy the contents of one folder to another. If the destination folder contains files or subdirectories with the same name as those in the source folder, they will be replaced.

## Usage

1. Set the `folderA` (source) and `folderB` (destination) variables in the script to the paths of your desired source and destination folders.
2. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   go run <script-name>.go
   ```
